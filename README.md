This is a ridiculous idea to make a website that relies mostly upon CSS.

An ultra simplified HTML doc is still required to create some basic structure, to create a link to the CSS file and for the files to be interpreted properly by a browserâ€”but all the content (and a wee bit of the site's structure) is being generated from CSS.

To view the site locally:

1. Clone this repo to your local machine
2. OPen the cssOnlySite.html file in the browser of your choice
